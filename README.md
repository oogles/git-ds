# git-ds

A git command extension that saves a diff of all uncommitted changes (staged, unstaged, and untracked) in the current branch. This diff can then be shared/synced in order to pick up where you left off on a different machine, to pass the changes onto someone else for completion and commit, or any other reason you can think of.
